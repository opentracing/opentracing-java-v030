/**
 * {@link ActiveSpan} inherits all of the OpenTracing functionality in {@link BaseSpan} and layers on in-process
 * propagation capabilities.
 *
 * <p>
 * In any given thread there is at most one {@link ActiveSpan "active" span} primarily responsible for the work
 * accomplished by the surrounding application code. That {@link ActiveSpan} may be accessed via the
 * {@link ActiveSpanSource#activeSpan()} method. If the application needs to defer work that should be part of
 * the same Span, the Source provides a {@link ActiveSpan#capture} method that returns a {@link Continuation};
 * this continuation may be used to re-activate and continue the {@link Span} in that other asynchronous executor
 * and/or thread.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link ActiveSpan}s are created via {@link Tracer.SpanBuilder#startActive()} or, less commonly,
 * {@link ActiveSpanSource#makeActive}. Per the above, they can be {@link ActiveSpan#capture()}ed as
 * {@link ActiveSpan.Continuation}s, then re-{@link Continuation#activate()}d later.
 *
 * <p>
 * NOTE: {@link ActiveSpan} extends {@link Closeable} rather than {@code AutoCloseable} in order to preserve support
 * for JDK1.6.
